# Image Processing App Turned Walkable 8-Bit Video Game Map - Tuple Hash Map (What began as a Sparse Matrix)

This is a C++ image processing app that allows the user to move a small person (or a red dot because I couldn't get specific things to work. Will discuss in my video) around an image using the arrow keys. The project uses SFML for rendering and input handling and focuses on Tuple Hash Maps for coordinates, allowing the user to interact with the environment.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
- A working C++ environment within VS Code (or an editor that you can get to work with this setup)
- A sense of humor
- Understanding that I'm not perfect and my code is less than desirable haha

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/cdseaholm/cspb2270finalProject.git
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Download and install SFML from [SFML's official website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
   - I'm not sure if you need to do this or not. I tried including the binaries like some instructions were saying to and I got it to work on mine but not sure if others will need download it as well or if I added it appropriately. 

3. **Build and Run the Project**:
   - Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Set up a C++ environment with Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022.
   - Run `code .` from that command prompt.
   - Use the build task in Visual Studio Code to compile the project. (I was using `Ctrl+Shift+P` from the VS Code terminal)
   - Execute `.\main.exe` from Developer Command Prompt.
